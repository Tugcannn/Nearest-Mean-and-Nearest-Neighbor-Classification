You are provided with two dataset files. As their names imply, the training.csv file will be used for
training and the testing.csv file will be used for testing. The datasets are created using only the last
two features of the original IRIS dataset. Each row of the files corresponds to one instance. The first
column of a row is the Petal Length(cm) and the second value is Petal Width (cm) and the last value
is the species of the flower. You have 90 instances (30 instances from each class) in training.csv file
and 60 instances (20 instances from each class) in testing.csv file.

1) Nearest Mean classifier
Implement the Nearest Mean classifier.
a) Plot instances of each species using a different color and mark the means on the plot.
b) Report the confusion matrices on training and test data.
2) k-Nearest Neighbor classifier
Implement the k-NN classifier.
a) Report the confusion matrix on the test data for k=1,3, and 5.
b) For k=1, 3, 5, 7, 9 plot the training and test accuracies as a function of k.
